title: Promotion Endorsements
---

<p>
	One  signal of career progression for an engineer is that their impact is positively felt by an ever increasing number of people. Furthermore, it's important to fairly assess people from across the organization, particularly so in more senior roles where they would be considered role models.
</p>

<p>
	With fairness and impact in mind, managers should use the table below as a guide in who endoresments should be collected from. These endorsements should be specific, contain examples and not passive/generic statements such as "I have no problem with this". That requirement becomes critical for senior promotions and up.
</p>

<p>
	A possible outcome of gathering endorsements could be areas for improvement, that may mean a promotion is delayed while the candidate is coached. This should not be seen as a negative outcome, but beneficial in personal development or challenging perceptions. If somebody is well managed, the feedback coming out of this process should not be a surprise.

	<b>It's very important to have an expectation that the endorsement process is not a formality</b>.
