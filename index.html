		About
	</h2>

	<p>
		This document is intended to provide clarity to the engineers and their managers in Scout24 as to what their job title means and to provide a basis for discussions for career development. Along with <a href="docs/promotion-endorsements.html">Promotion Endorsements</a>, this document should improve the fairness of decision making no matter what team or department an engineer is in.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you're new to this, it is worth taking a look at <a href="docs/how-to-read-this.html">this How To page</a> and the <a href="docs/glossary.html">Glossary</a>.
		All the pages in Levels & Definitions are formatted to be printable.
		If you'd like to suggest a change, please read the <a href="https://github.com/Scout24/ic-levels-and-titles/blob/master/README.md">Readme</a>.
