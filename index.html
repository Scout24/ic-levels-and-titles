	About
</h2>

<p>
	This document is intended to provide clarity to the engineers and their managers in Scout24 as to what their job title means and to provide a basis for discussions on career development.
	Along with <a href="{{"/docs/promotion-endorsements.html" | relative_url}}">Promotion Endorsements</a>, the Levels & Definitions should help provide fairness and consistency in promotions and hiring no matter what team or department an engineer is in.
