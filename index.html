	About
</h2>

<p>
	This document is intended to provide clarity to the engineers and their managers in Scout24 as to what their job title means and to provide a basis for discussions for career development.
	Along with <a href="{{"/docs/promotion-endorsements.html" | relative_url}}">Promotion Endorsements</a>, the Levels & Definitions should improve the fairness of promotions and hiring no matter what team or department an engineer is in.
</p>

<p>
	If you're new to this, it is worth reading <a href="{{"/docs/how-to-read-this.html" | relative_url}}">this How To page</a> and the <a href="{{"/docs/glossary.html" | relative_url}}">Glossary</a>.
	All the pages in Levels & Definitions are formatted to be printable.
	If you'd like to suggest a change, please read the <a href="https://github.com/Scout24/ic-levels-and-titles/blob/master/README.md">Readme</a>.
